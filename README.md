# i3x-status
**i3x-status** means "extensible i3status".

[i3status](https://github.com/i3/i3status) has done a great job on generating status bar for i3bar, though to extend the functionality is rather complex.

Here i3x-status struggles to hold as a server provided with basic info, and read info sent by other extensions by FIFO or something else.
